## How to Get a Good Deal on a Travel Trailer

Travel trailers are sold on much higher margins than regular vehicles are.  This is largely due to the fact that RV sales lots make the vast majority of their sales in the summer months and see much less action during the rest of the year.  That is true, at least, in the 3/4 of the country that actually has a winter.  Also, a travel trailer is a luxury item, so they are often purchased by people who can pay more.  In fact, I spent less on my new car than I did on my camper which doesn’t even have an engine in it.

I respect that RV sales lots need to make their living, but I also want to get the best deal possible.  Here are a few things that have worked for me, or which I’ve heard work well for others.

Before you make a big investment on your own camper, renting one is a great way to try before you buy. At RVShare, you can find tons of travel trailers to rent at great prices.  You can see your local rental inventory by [clicking here](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100173535-14011875).

### SHOP THE ENTIRE COUNTRY FOR A TRAVEL TRAILER

I negotiated very hard for my trailer and shopped every single dealership within 100 miles of my home to find the absolute best price possible.  Still, I paid $3,000 more for my trailer than just the list price of the same trailer for sale at dealerships in Indiana.  Why?  Freight is less to the dealership, and regional dealerships can sell year-round so they don’t have to mark up the trailers as high.

Shipping a travel trailer can be very expensive.  In fact, it commonly costs $2 per mile due to the large size, heavy weight, and difficulty in loading a camper.  So the freight costs to get the camper to the dealership.  The hub for the manufacturing of RV’s in the United States is Indiana, so freight costs in the south and midwest are low to get the trailer to the dealership.

If you find a trailer you like locally, it’s worth googling the model number/name of the trailer to find other dealerships in other areas of the country.  See what their list prices are to get an idea of what kind of markup your dealer is putting on the trailer, and if it could be worth calling the dealership in another state and inquiring about having the trailer shipped.  Or, you could hop in the truck and go on a road trip.  It might actually be worth it, and what a way to break in a trailer!

### LOOK FOR LIGHTLY USED

The average recreational vehicle is traded in or sold every three years.  This is largely due to the fact that people’s needs change over time: another kid means you need another bunk, the kids leave home and mom and dad want a Class C, people don’t get out as often as they thought they would so they sell, etc.

This means that there is frequently a high volume of used trailers on the market.  Before you purchase a new trailer, at least look through your local dealerships, Craigslist, and [RVTrader.com](http://rvtrader.com/) to see what options are available.

When I recently bought a camper trailer, I looked at new trailers first.  This was a mistake because then when I saw lightly used trailers, I just kept comparing them to the shiny new ones.  I wish I’d looked only at lightly used trailers for the first few weeks to see if anything fit my needs and looked nice, and THEN if I didn’t find anything, start looking at new trailers.  I probably could have saved quite a lot of money.

Used camper trailers don’t depreciate as much as some other recreational vehicles, such as ski boats and motorhomes, but you can often save some several thousand dollars by buying a trailer that is only 2 or 3 years old and has seen little use.

In [this article](https://camperreport.com/pdi-inspection-checklist/), I tell used RV buyers how to do a 100 point inspection before they make their purchase. Read it to make sure you aren’t surprised when bringing your “new” used RV home!

### PIT DEALERSHIPS AGAINST EACH OTHER

This is my favorite technique for buying an RV.  It gave me the leverage I needed to talk the dealership down $6,000 on a recent RV purchase.

When I bought my trailer, the cost was initially $29,000 for the trailer I wanted.  But I found a very similar floorplan in a trailer that wasn’t as nice of a brand at a different dealership.  After working with them, I got them to agree to sell it to me for $23,700.  I wrote down the details of the sale and that price on a piece of paper and took it to the dealership that had the trailer that was more expensive.  I told the salesman the honest truth.

The truth was that I was ready to buy a trailer that day.  I had the money and I decided I’d buy the trailer from the other dealership for $23,000, but I wanted to drop by and see if this dealership could give me a better deal.  In the end, I saved $6,000 off the price of the trailer that was better quality and was the one I wanted—all because I had some leverage.

I also used this same negotiating technique when I bought a car a couple years ago.  I found two cars I liked at different dealerships and didn’t allow myself to fall in love with one specific car.  I visited both dealerships and said the truth.  I honestly liked both cars equally and so I was going to go with whoever could give me the better price.  This worked so well that I even got the salesmen from the two dealerships to call each other and negotiate directly!  Ha!  I was smiling ear to ear while I sat there listening to the salesmen on the phone with each other fighting over the price.  It was awesome!  I ended up with a great deal and walked away absolutely certain that I had the best possible price.

Negotiating is not rude.  It’s your job as the provider for your family.  As long as you are honest, you should work to get the best price.  The dealerships are big boys and girls.  They aren’t going to sell unless it’s a good deal for them, so you don’t have to feel guilty about working hard to get a good price.

### NEVER BUY ON YOUR FIRST VISIT

Every salesperson knows that the first visit is the best time to get someone to buy, because they can work on your impulses.  Their goal is to match you with a trailer that sparks your liking, and then make it feel like you need to do whatever it takes to get it.

I like to make it obvious to the salesperson right from the get-go that I’m visiting all of the dealerships to compare and price shop.  This helps salespeople who are a little too eager to relax a bit, and puts yourself in a better negotiating position when it comes time to talk price.

This is also important because you may change your mind on what you want as you look at more and more RVs.  On my recent purchase, I first thought I wanted a tent trailer and ended up with a larger hard-side travel trailer.  I took many visits to dealerships before I realized that what I initially thought I wanted was perhaps not the best.

# Take An RV Road Trip To 3 New National Landmarks

Written by [Natalie Henley](https://camperreport.com/author/natalie-henley/)  in [Beginner Info](https://camperreport.com/category/beginner-info/)

## Take An RV Road Trip To 3 New National Landmarks

Planning your RV road trip routes for the year already? You may want to consider squeezing at least one of these three notable locations into the itinerary. In January, Former Secretary of the Interior David L. Bernhardt named three new sites as national natural landmarks.  

These sites are located in West Virginia, Colorado, and California. Their addition brings the number of national natural landmarks in the United States, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to 602, a milestone for the National Park Service’s [National Natural Landmarks Program.](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nnlandmarks/index.htm?utm_source=rvlife) 

> “With more than 600 national natural landmarks, we recognize and celebrate the breadth and diversity of America’s natural beauty and our partners for their commitment to conserving America’s natural heritage,” said Former Secretary Bernhardt.

National Natural Landmarks are selected by the Secretary of the Interior, and consideration is based on the site’s condition, exemplary character, rarity, diversity, and value to science and education. The program seeks to spotlight the best examples of remaining biological and/or geological features and takes measures to conserve what is left.

## RV road trip destination options

### Bear Rocks and Allegheny Front Preserve, West Virginia

[Bear Rocks and Allegheny Front Preserve](https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/bear-rocks-preserve/?utm_source=rvlife), located in Grant and Tucker Counties, is owned by The Nature Conservancy. The most distinctive feature of the preserve is the rocky, high-altitude plateau. This mountain-turned-plateau landscape resulted from continental plates colliding millions of years ago and then slowly eroding over the years by ice, rain, wind, and water. 

![](/img/home-jumbotron.jpg)

The 4,000-foot elevation and cool climate of the preserve supports a distinct and diverse species of plants and animals that would otherwise be found farther north in Canada. Lightly treaded trails traverse throughout the landscape, giving hikers a closer look at wind-swept and stunted spruce trees, low-lying heath shrubs, rock outcrops, and bogs. Visitors may spot snowshoe hares and saw-whet owls. It is also a sanctuary for the Cheat Mountain salamander, a species on the federal threatened and endangered list. 

Camping is not allowed in the preserve. A few campgrounds like [Canaan Valley Resort State Park](https://www.campgroundreviews.com/regions/west-virginia/davis/canaan-valley-resort-state-park-3210) and  [Riverside Cabins & RV Park](https://www.campgroundreviews.com/regions/west-virginia/moorefield/riverside-cabins-rv-park-13889) nearby are just an hour’s drive away.

### Sulphur Cave and Spring, Colorado

Sulphur Cave and Spring, located just west of downtown Steamboat Springs, Colorado, is owned by the City of Steamboat Springs. The cave is undergoing an extremely rare sulfuric acid speleogenesis (development). It is the only one of its kind in the state.

Amazingly, this highly toxic environment of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide gases is home to a flourishing ecological community. 



![](/img/products-grid1.jpg)

The cave contains many uncommon features, including

* bacterial mats,
* biovermiculations (wavy lines on cave walls and ceilings that host an active microbial flora),
* gypsum crystals,
* native sulfur,
* snotties (mucus-like soda straws that hang from the cave’s ceiling),
* and Limnodrilus Sulphurensis (a blood-red worm found nowhere else in the world)

Scientists are particularly interested in the worm. A closer look at these specimens has led them to believe that the worms can help understand what can survive in low oxygen environments, such as the planet Mars, and find ways to aid people with circulatory issues.

Since people cannot enter the cave due to its toxic air, folks can still learn more about the landmark at the [Tread of Pioneers Museum](https://www.treadofpioneers.org/?utm_source=rvlife) in Steamboat Springs. They have an entire exhibit featuring the area’s plethora of springs, including the Sulphur Cave. An actual worm from the cave is part of the display.

There are a reported 150 springs in the area varying in temperature from 40 to 150 degrees. Visitors can explore the town and find many of the springs at their leisure. Plus, there is no shortage of [RV campgrounds](https://www.campgroundreviews.com/regions/colorado/steamboat-springs) in and around Steamboat Springs, CO.

The video below, provided by the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/?utm_source=rvlife), showcases the Bear Rocks and Allegheny Front Preserve and Sulphur Cave and Spring, number 600 and 601 landmarks.

### Lanphere and Ma-le’l Dunes, California

[Lanphere and Ma-le’l Dunes](https://www.blm.gov/visit/ma-lel-dunes-cma?utm_source=rvlife) is located west of Arcata in northwestern California and owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The ecosystem was deemed the 602nd National Natural Landmark because of its diverse vegetation and quality remnants of coastal dunes in the area.

Coastal dunes are among the rarest systems along the west coast due to commercial and residential development and invasive species like European beachgrass. The Lanphere and Ma-le’l Dunes are seemingly untouched, keeping much of the features that once thrived on the west coast. Besides dunes, the site includes beaches, dune forest islands, salt marshes, deflation plain swales, freshwater marshes, and brackish wetlands.

The Ma-le’l Dunes are open to the public from sunrise to sunset every day. Permits are required to visit the Lanphere Dunes. Guided walking tours are offered by [Friends of the Dunes](https://www.friendsofthedunes.org/guided-walks?utm_source=rvlife). Extending your stay in the location is no problem with the many [campgrounds](https://www.campgroundreviews.com/regions/california/arcata) in and around Arcata.

### WATCH OUT FOR THE MISSING PIECES

Pricing on trailers is often very misleading.  Suppose you see a $20,000 trailer at one dealership, and a $22,000 trailer at another dealership.  Obviously you’d think the $20,000 trailer is less expensive, but that may not be true.

After visiting 10 dealerships in the last few weeks and asking many of them to give me the nitty-gritty details, here are a few add-ons and missing things that I saw at the dealerships:

* One dealership offered yearly winterizing for as long as I own the trailer.  That would save me $120 per year for many years.
* One dealership had a storage facility and offered free storage for a year.
* One dealership had a $400 freight fee and a $350 processing fee
* Most of the dealerships I visited did not include hoses for the trailer, so I’d have to buy them at additional cost
* Only half of the dealerships included the two batteries I’d need for my trailer.  Some came with one and some didn’t include any batteries.
* Sales tax is not included in the price.  If your state has 6% sales tax, you’ll pay an extra $1,200.  That number will be the same at all of the lots, but it’s important to know that it’ll be tacked on to the price.
* Dealer doc and title fees are also added to the price.  A doc fee is commonly $250 and a title fee is usually under $50.
* Many trailers don’t come with things that you’ll certainly want to buy right away such as a spare tire and cover to mount on the back.
* You’ll also need to purchase a generator.  You should budget between $1,000 and $2,500 for a good generator depending on your preferences.  Don’t be “that guy” who buys the deafeningly-loud $400 generator from Lowes and drives the whole campground crazy.

### Negotiate for a Gift Card

When you purchase your new travel trailer, you’ll have a lot of associated expenses.  From little things like buying a black water hose, to big things like a generator.  If you purchase your new travel trailer from a dealership that also has a store with accessories (most dealerships do), then once you feel like you’ve got all the money out of the negotiation that you can, ask for a $250 gift card to their store to push you over the edge.

A gift card isn’t as expensive for them to give because they have obviously marked up the items in the store, and you’ll need to buy some things anyway.

### Check Out Different Brands

Some travel trailers command an extremely high price simply because of the brand name.  Airstream trailers are notorious for charging a fat premium just because of their style and name.

Check out [my article on average prices for new trailers](https://camperreport.com/average-cost-new-travel-trailers-16-examples/) to get an idea of the HUGE price variability between trailers of the same floorplan and size.

## Rent Before Buying

If you’re considering buying an RV or Camper, I strongly suggest you rent one first to make sure it’s one you’ll really love.  Campers can be very large investments, and buying the wrong one can be a costly mistake. [RVShare](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100173535-14011875) is a great place for finding RVs and Campers to rent in your local area.

### Conclusion

I hope you find a great deal on your new trailer.  If you know that you have a hard time being brave enough to negotiate a deal, follow these tips to make sure you don’t get taken.  Good luck to you!
